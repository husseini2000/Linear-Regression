# Prediction using supervised ML

## Overview
This is a simple task. It was assigned to me from the Sparks Foundation organiztion to implement linear regression technique, So
we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

## Problem statement
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

## Description
I solved this task and made some predictions using data that was allowed to me to use it for the task, so you will see:
1. How to impelement simple linear regression using the Python Scikit-Learn library ?
2. What are the required Packages for linear regression ?
3. Simple explaination of each essential Package I used.
4. What are five basic steps to be considered when youâ€™re implementing linear regression ?
5. Show how to implement each of these five steps practically in this notebook.
6. What are metrics used to evaluate linear regression model ?
7. 
## What are the technologies usedin this Notebook ?
1. Scikit-Learn
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Numpy

## What is upcoming ?
I may try to write clean code with depth explaination of each cell, and may try to make this notebook to be as a reference to revision linear regression and answer questions like
1. What is machine learning ?
2. What are types of machine learning ?
3. What is the differece between classification and regression ?
